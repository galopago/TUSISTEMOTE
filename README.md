# VERSATILE, COMPACT AND ROBUST ELECTRONIC HARDWARE PROTOTYPING SYSTEM


Tusistemote is modular ecosystem that uses pre-made PCB to mix and match your choice of processor board. Is oriented to make small, mobile, battery powered electronic projects work in real conditions in a very short time.

The ecosystem follows 3 simple rules:

* PCB: pre-made, simple and easy to replicate prototyping boards
* Enclosure: Generic, waterproof, low cost, easily available.
* Cable entry: Cable glands for external sensors or power

## PCB DESIGN

The PCB design followed one simple principle: Try to place the MCU board as close as possible to a corner, maximizing the contiguos available pcb remaingin space.
