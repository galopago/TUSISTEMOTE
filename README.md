# VERSATILE, COMPACT AND ROBUST ELECTRONIC HARDWARE PROTOTYPING SYSTEM


Tusistemote is an Open Source, modular ecosystem that uses pre-made PCB to mix and match your choice of processor board. Is oriented to make small, mobile, battery powered electronic projects work in real conditions in a very short time.

The ecosystem follows 3 simple rules:

* PCB: pre-made, simple and easy to replicate prototyping boards
* Enclosure: Generic, waterproof, low cost, easily available.
* Cable entry: Cable glands for external sensors or power

## PCB DESIGN

The PCB design followed one simple principle: Try to place the MCU board as close as possible to a corner, maximizing the contiguos available pcb remaingin space.

Small microcontroller         |Medium MCU                      | Big MCU

Female headers could be added to make MCU module reusable, and to gain some space below. Notice battery socket placed in available space!

## WATERPROOF ENCLOSURE

The best enclosures suited for the system are the ones that doesnt need to be opened to be fixed/unfixed from the wall.
