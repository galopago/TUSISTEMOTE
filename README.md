# TUSISTEMOTE

## VERSATILE, COMPACT AND ROBUST ELECTRONIC HARDWARE PROTOTYPING SYSTEM

Tusistemote is an Open Source, modular ecosystem that uses pre-made PCB to mix and match your choice of processor board. Is oriented to make small, mobile, battery powered electronic projects work in real conditions in a very short time.

The ecosystem follows 3 simple rules:

* PCB: pre-made, simple and easy to replicate prototyping boards
* Enclosure: Generic, waterproof, low cost, easily available.
* Cable entry: Cable glands for external sensors or power

## PCB DESIGN

The PCB design followed one simple principle: Try to place the MCU board as close as possible to a corner, maximizing the contiguous available PCB remaining space.

Female headers could be added to make MCU module reusable, and to gain some space below. Notice battery socket placed in available space!

## WATERPROOF ENCLOSURE

The best enclosures suited for the system are the ones that have external mount points and doesn't need to be opened to be fixed/detached.

Depending of the enclosure used there are two methods for PCB fixation: Self tapping screws or flexible foam.

## CABLE ENTRY

If the project needs an external wired sensor or power cord, a cable gland should be used to stop exterior impurities from cause any damage to internal components. They also offer strain relief for the internal connections.
